## Quick plot

You can directly call the `get_and_plot_results` to get a plot with the performance
of implicit vs explicit matrix-vector multiplication. You can check the arguments 
of the function to get more control over the experiment, like the range of the 
objects size and type. 

## Get the numerical results
Call the `experiment` function with an instance of Expparams.
